# Contributing to Chang
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested.
3. Issue that pull request!
