# CHANG - Penetration Testing Planning

![CHANG Logo](logo.png)

CHANG is a Penetration Testing Planning App, inspired by the quote "Without strategy, execution is aimless. Without execution, strategy is useless." by Morris Chang. This app is built using Streamlit, a Python web app framework, to assist penetration testers in planning and organizing their penetration testing activities. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting and managing various aspects of a penetration test.
